You are an expert in prompt engineering and annotation task design. I need your help to iteratively improve a prompt for labeling soundboarding in emotional-support conversations.

## Background Context

I have been using a prompt (provided below as "Original Prompt") to instruct a large language model (LLM) to label utterances in emotional-support conversations for the presence of soundboarding. The original task was binary classification: label each utterance as 1 (soundboarding) or 0 (not soundboarding).

However, I have identified a significant discrepancy: there are 25 cases where the LLM labeled utterances as 1 (soundboarding), but human annotators (two independent annotators) both labeled them as 0 (not soundboarding). This suggests that the current prompt may be leading the LLM to over-identify soundboarding.

**Important Change**: For the improved prompt, I want to change the output format from binary (0/1) to a continuous score between 0.0 and 1.0, where:
- 0.0 = definitely not soundboarding
- 1.0 = definitely soundboarding  
- Values in between represent degrees of soundboarding likelihood (e.g., 0.3 = low likelihood, 0.7 = high likelihood)

## Original Prompt

## Misclassification Data

I have a table containing 25 cases of misclassification. Each case includes:
- **Index**: The utterance identifier (e.g., "1.5", "2.3")
- **Content**: The Seeker's utterance that was misclassified
- **supporter-pre**: The Supporter's utterance immediately before this Seeker utterance (context)
- **supporter-post**: The Supporter's utterance immediately after this Seeker utterance (context)
- **gpt5**: The LLM's label (all are 1 in this dataset)
- **annotator1**: Human annotator 1's label (all are 0)
- **annotator2**: Human annotator 2's label (all are 0)
- **human_aggregate**: Aggregate human label (0, since both annotators said 0)

The table will be provided separately. For each case, you should consider:
1. The Seeker's utterance itself
2. The conversational context (what the Supporter said before and after)
3. Why the LLM might have labeled it as 1
4. Why humans labeled it as 0

## Your Task

Please analyze this situation and provide a comprehensive response in the following structure:

### Part 1: Root Cause Analysis

First, analyze why the LLM is labeling these 25 utterances as soundboarding (1) when humans consistently label them as 0. Consider:
- What patterns or linguistic features in these utterances might have triggered the LLM's "soundboarding" label?
- How might the original prompt's guidelines be ambiguous or leading to over-identification?
- What contextual cues (from supporter-pre and supporter-post) might the LLM be misinterpreting?
- Are there specific words, phrases, or sentence structures that appear frequently in these misclassified cases?

Provide a detailed analysis of the root causes.

### Part 2: Three Improvement Plans

Based on your analysis, propose THREE distinct plans to improve the prompt. Each plan should:

**Plan 1: [Name/Description]**
- Specific changes to make to the prompt
- Rationale for why these changes would address the misclassification issue
- Expected impact on reducing false positives

**Plan 2: [Name/Description]**
- Specific changes to make to the prompt
- Rationale for why these changes would address the misclassification issue
- Expected impact on reducing false positives

**Plan 3: [Name/Description]**
- Specific changes to make to the prompt
- Rationale for why these changes would address the misclassification issue
- Expected impact on reducing false positives

Each plan should take a different approach (e.g., one might focus on clarifying definitions, another on adding negative examples, another on emphasizing context).

### Part 3: Plan Recommendation

Compare the three plans and recommend which one you believe would be most effective. Explain:
- Why this plan is superior to the others
- What combination of elements from different plans might work best
- Any potential risks or limitations of the recommended approach

### Part 4: Final Improved Prompt

Provide the complete, revised prompt that incorporates your recommended improvements. The prompt should:
- Maintain the original structure and format
- Clearly address the identified issues
- Be ready to use for the annotation task
- Include all necessary components (definition, guidelines, examples, output format)
- **IMPORTANT**: The output format should be a continuous score between 0 and 1 (not binary 0/1), where:
  - 0.0 means definitely not soundboarding
  - 1.0 means definitely soundboarding
  - Values closer to 1 indicate higher likelihood of soundboarding
  - Values closer to 0 indicate lower likelihood of soundboarding
  - The score should reflect the degree/confidence of soundboarding presence

### Part 5: Thinking Process

Document your complete thinking process throughout this analysis:
- How you identified patterns in the misclassified cases
- Your reasoning for each proposed change
- Trade-offs you considered
- Why you ultimately chose the recommended approach

## Important Notes

- Focus on reducing false positives (cases labeled as 1 by LLM but 0 by humans)
- Maintain the prompt's ability to correctly identify true soundboarding cases
- Consider the conversational context when making recommendations
- Be specific and actionable in your suggestions
- Ensure the improved prompt is clear, unambiguous, and easy for an LLM to follow
- **Output Format Requirement**: The improved prompt must output a continuous score between 0.0 and 1.0 (not binary 0/1), representing the likelihood/degree of soundboarding. Examples: 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0

Please begin your analysis. I will provide the table of 25 misclassified cases in the next message.
