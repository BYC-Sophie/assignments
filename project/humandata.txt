1. seeker_5: could be better — 0 — brief emotional venting without reasoning
 supporter_5: I am sorry to hear that. Would you like to talk about anything specific? — 0 — invitation to elaborate
2. seeker_5: thank you, I just don't know what else to do to get a job? — 0 — direct request for advice
 supporter_5: So you're unemployed? I am sorry to hear that. Are you prepared to take jobs that are below your usual level just to get by for a while? — 0 — supportive inquiry
3. seeker_5: have tried that but don't even get an interview — 0 — factual frustration
 supporter_5: It's a very difficult time to be out of work, I know. I hope that there is something out there for you. Have you tried employment agencies? — 0 — advice and question
4. seeker_5: yes, I do not qualify for unemployment because I have savings above the min threshold and I also have rental property, which is currently loss making and I can't sell it because it's 30% below market value — 0 — factual explanation of situation
 supporter_5: Well, on the plus side at least you do have savings .. hopefully this can give you some security for a while — 0 — reassurance
 supporter_5: Are your family being supportive of your situation? — 0 — question
5. seeker_5: it's almost depleted, been out of work now for nearly 9 months but still can't get unemployment support because of the property that I cannot get rid off else I will declared bankrupt by the mortgage lender — 1 — reflective reasoning about difficult financial trap
 supporter_5: Perhaps bankruptcy might not be a bad option? You would be eligible for some help then at least. — 0 — suggestion
6. seeker_5: family is not being fully supported compared to when I had full time job. had to get rid of one car and other things just to get by — 0 — factual account of changes
7. seeker_5: but the cost is 7 years of my future??? — 1 — self-reflective expression of fear and consequence evaluation — 1 — follow-up reflection – 1 – They are murmuring a self-directed reasoning here, where they try to soundboard the consequence of the supporter’s suggestion of bankruptcy. They are doing an internal evaluation this way.

 supporter_5: So you feel as though you have been working hard all your life and now you need help and support and are not getting it — 0 — paraphrasing for empathy
8. seeker_5: very well put. seems i am being penalised for working hard, saving and investing? I should have been on more holidays and lived all the way above my means! — 1 — reflective reasoning and self-directed commentary  — 1 — “I should have …” retrospective self reflection – 1 – Here, the seeker is expressing the irony of the situation, where we could interpret it as either self-directed reasoning or a function of emotional regulation. I think this is soundboarding because it is neither pure emotional venting without reasoning nor directly asking for supporter’s thought

 supporter_5: I know how you feel .. I sometimes feel I would have been better off if I'd just not bothered working! — 0 — empathetic self-disclosure
 supporter_5: Anyway thank you for talking and I really hope things go better for you in the future :) — 0 — supportive closure

 supporter_5: Yes it's been done :) — 0 — confirmation
 supporter_5: Please can you quit. I have other things to do and if I have to leave because you did not end this neither of us gets anything. It can only be ended your side. — 0 — logistical request

 supporter_1001: Hell, How can I help? — 0 — inquiry
2. seeker_1001: I'm ashamed of how I look which makes me anxious when I have to attend zoom meetings, I have to leave my camera off. It feels like cheating! — 1 — self-reflective reasoning about anxiety and self-image — 1 — building on previous self-disclosure

 supporter_1001: Initially, I used to feel like that and never shared my camera but I know I can do all the time. — 0 — self-disclosure from supporter
4. seeker_1001: oh really? how long did it take you to get up the nerve....its been months and months of mic only for me lol...and the silly thing is the people i'm zooming with aren't particularly attractive so I shouldn't feel ashamed. — 1 — reflective acknowledgment of irrational self-judgment
 supporter_1001: When I saw many people were sharing camera and they didnt care about anything - few sitting in room full of mess but they dint care. — 0 — supportive sharing
5. seeker_1001: in person i am much more confidant...would like to care less. — 1 — self-reflective desire for change  — 1 — self-reflective follow up about what they would like – 1 – ? To me, it fell like the seeker giving a response to the supporter’s previous comment about other people “not caring”, but it might still be soundboarding because it has the feature of self reflective reasoning
6. seeker_1001: care less about being on cam i mean — 1 — clarification of self-directed thought  – 1 – self reflective reasoning where they are more obviously soundboarding
7. seeker_1001: some people look so comfortable and relaxed! I just get seized up with anxiety — 1 — reflective acknowledgment of emotional reaction — 1 — self-reflective about emotional state; comparative to others 
 supporter_1001: correct - it is just our mind thing which stops us not to share but once you start sharing you will feel confident. — 0 — reassurance and advice
 supporter_1001: Once you dont care what people think you will be more confident. — 0 — motivational advice
 supporter_1001: You will also be used to it — 0 — reassurance
8. seeker_1001: maybe i should take the plunge...it seems so silly to me because logically i am not in these meetings to impress anyone — 1 — reflective reasoning about internal contradiction — 1 — self reflective – 1 – Seeker is doing self-directed reasoning aloud and organizing their thoughts. The utterance also includes the hedging features.
9. seeker_1001: maybe i'll pick the least threatening meeting and start there...one that's a smaller group — 1 — self-directed planning and reasoning — 1 — back-to-back self-reflection – 1 – Same reason as the last utterance. The tone matches my impression of soundboarding better here.
 supporter_1001: You can also try different backgrounds in Zoom which will improve the way you will look. — 0 — practical suggestion
10. seeker_1001: oh really? I haven't experimented with that. maybe I can get a friend to practise that with me — 1 — reflective planning to test a solution
11. seeker_1001: that's a good idea — 1 — affirmation of self-directed plan — 1 — follow up reflection about the idea being good – 1 – Follow up on their own thought

12. seeker_1001: its hard I'm getting older now (50's) and its hard seeing my appearance go downhill. But at least it's happening with my other friends too lol. Gravity is a bitch! — 1 — self-reflective acknowledgment with humor
13. seeker_1001: what age group are you in? — 0 — social question
 supporter_1001: I am nearly 50 as well. People over 50s looks better and I am sure your appearance is good as well. It is just thinking. — 0 — reassurance
14. seeker_1001: hmm yes....my attitude and self defeating thoughts....i need to work on that, thank you for your encouragement — 1 — self-reflective realization about mindset — 1 — self reflection about what the person says they need to work on – 1 – Self reflection on things they need to work on
 supporter_1001: It is all inside and outside appearance doesnt matter — 0 — reassurance
15. seeker_1001: You know you're right there — 1 — acknowledgment of self-reflective agreement
 supporter_1001: All people over 50s are graceful - honest opinion. — 0 — reassurance
16. seeker_1001: maybe it's like a lot of things for me, that always seem worse until i try them, then i'm like "what was I so worried about" — 1 — reflective generalization and realization — 1 — self reflection: “[things] always seem worse until I try them…” – 1 – Self-directed reasoning that connects their situation to the past pattern of behavior. They are more self reflecting than responding to the supporters here.

 supporter_1001: No worries about anything and enjoy life. — 0 — advice
 supporter_1001: 100% agreed - Initially, all looks difficult but by the time all becomes easy and we become so used to it. — 0 — reassurance

20. seeker_1001: amen to that....it being over soon....we have all had to be so very patient — 0 — hopeful remark
21. seeker_1001: thankyou for your help today. so I will first practise with a friend, and play around with backgrounds. then I will take the plunge in a low-key small meeting and see how it goes — 1 — reflective planning and self-directed decision — 1 — person expressing gratitude and reflecting in a repeat response  – 1– repeating their own response for reflection and expressing gratitude

12. seeker_523: Im going to bundle up and go to the beach. Probably walk down to the pier 1 mile — 1 — self-directed plan and reasoning aloud
 supporter_523: That will be good. Make sure you can take some time and really appreciate not being in the house. — 0 — advice
 supporter_523: Is there any music or podcats you can listen to while out? — 0 — question
13. seeker_523: Thats good advice, Im feeling a little better — 0 — acknowledgment of emotional improvement
14. seeker_523: I can take my iphone for music — 0 — factual response – 1 – this can potentially be soundboarding since this is a self-directed thought where they verbalized a solution for themselves, following up to the last utterance of their own. 
 supporter_523: I am glad. Practicing mindfulness can really help, and help put things in perspective. Often times we build things up to be even worse than they already are. Being able to be grateful for what's around can help, without diminishing the issues that you are facing. — 0 — advice
15. seeker_523: Thats good advice, thanks I think you helped me — 0 — gratitude
 supporter_523: Remembering that it's okay to be sad and depressed, as much as it sucks, can be helpful in reframing. It's a rough time for everyone and you definitely are not alone. — 0 — reassurance
16. seeker_523: Thats true, it just seems like I am alone cause well I am lol — 1 — self-reflective humor and emotional reasoning acknowledgement following their self-reflection of the feeling of isolation could also be seen as the features of emotional regulation

 supporter_523: Smart cats are the best. They know when you need cuddles, which it sounds like you do! Also means you aren't alone. ;) Cat needs ya! As much as they don't want to admit it. — 0 — reassurance
19. seeker_523: He's my buddy for sure. Makes me happy to think of him — 1 — self-reflective recognition of emotional support  — 1 — “makes me happy to think of him” seems self reflective without prompting to think about what makes the person happy
 supporter_523: If you are healthy/feel comfortable with going out, you could consider volunteering at an animal shelter. You'd get to interact with some folks, some animals, and add something to the resume. I don't know if you are likely to get hours back at work or what you do, but that could be fun! — 0 — advice
20. seeker_523: Thats a good idea I'll look into it. Well we better wrap this hit up? — 0 — acknowledgment and closure attempt

3.seeker_632: thank you for that. i just wish i either had more hours or made more at a time. working part time just isnt cutting it. — 1 — reflective reasoning about financial stress and desire for stability
4.seeker_632: it is good that they are making progress on the vaccines. i just question their testing and how they are doing it. — 1 — reflective reasoning and critical thought — 1 — further reflection in a follow up message (glad progress is being made, but curious about methods) – 1 – the “i just question their…” It feels like a thought aloud where they express their own skepticism to organize their feelings about the news. It also involved self-directed reasoning
supporter_632: I understand. Part time or reduced hours can be a source of concern. — 0 — empathy
5.seeker_632: and i desperately need to move out of the situation that i am in. but cant do it with my current level of income. — 1 — reflective statement connecting emotion and circumstance
supporter_632: We just need to trust them to bring the vaccine to the public. I hope in due time they will publish their detailed research and development papers. — 0 — general comment

Conversation 5:
1.seeker_324: Hi, how are you? — 0 — greeting, not reflective
 supporter_324: I good, how are you feeling? — 0 — question
2. seeker_324: I am worried that COVID-19 has made me depressed. I am usually a well mannered, even personality but I find myself impatient and possibly getting depressed. — 1 — self-reflective reasoning about emotional change
 supporter_324: So you think that COVID-19 has made you depressed? Could there be anything else that could be bothering you? — 0 — probing question
3. seeker_324: Possibly... I think the remote learning of my kids and the iability to leave the house or go out, is making me sadder than normal. — 1 — self-reflective reasoning on sources of distress – 1 – We see some traits of soundboarding like hedging, where they are responding to the supporter but in the way thinking aloud to discover the answer.
 supporter_324: I completely understand where you are coming from there. I feel like remote learning takes away from some of the social aspects of life that need to happen in order for a healthy life. — 0 — empathetic statement
4. seeker_324: I am also worried that I am not playing the political game well. I feel like I am too straight forward, not rude, but I should play politics more to get ahead. — 1 — introspective evaluation of self and career strategy   — 1 — “I am also…” indicating an addendum to the initial thought with more self reflection – 1 – Here is more of a self-directed reasoning because the seeker is verbalizing an internal conflict and evaluating their behavior, I can say it’s soundboarding because it’s not directly responding to the supporter

 supporter_324: I understand that as well. It seems that no matter how politically involved we are, things are always changing. — 0 — general empathy
 supporter_324: Change is a good thing though as it makes us stronger as people. Do you have any hobbies/interests? — 0 — advice and question
5. seeker_324: I agree. As I deal with more and more power, there seems to be more politics. — 1 — reflective acknowledgment of professional complexity
6. seeker_324: Yes, I like to watch movies and workout. THat's about it. with a wife and 2 kids, I don't have more time. — 0 — factual explanation  — 1 — discloses and reflects on lack of time in a follow up message

 supporter_324: Sometimes some of the best things we can do is t get out and away from all the things that WE as people have created. Get into the woods and throw a ball around. — 0 — advice
7. seeker_324: That would be nice. Is that what you do when you are stressed or depressed? — 0 — inquiry to supporter
 supporter_324: I understand, especially having the remote learning going on, it is hard to get away from work and school. — 0 — empathetic observation
8. seeker_324: Yeah. How do you cope with your stresses? I find myself drinking more than I want now too. — 1 — self-reflective admission of unhealthy coping behavior
 supporter_324: I try to, I love packing a day back with some easy snacks, and going out for a hike through the woods. Sometimes I use the state trails but sometimes I just go out and make my own new trail. — 0 — personal disclosure
9. seeker_324: That's fun. I try to get out once a month for a nice hike. We did the Indiana Dunes last month and that was good. With the snow coming, it might be more snow shoeing moving forward. — 1 — reflective reasoning on activity adaptation
 supporter_324: Well, drinking doesn't really deal with it. It only pushes things off for later to deal with. Exercising is a really good way to deal with that stress. — 0 — advice
10. seeker_324: Yeah. I have not missed a workout since COVID-19 started. That seems to keep me grounded. — 1 — reflective insight on positive coping mechanism
 supporter_324: That's true! I used to live in Ohio, and the weather was amazing this time of year. — 0 — casual comment
11. seeker_324: Yeah. In chicago, we have a lot of snow but also some good state trails. It's been helpful, especially when this first started. I live across the street from a forest preserve, which was a life saver. — 1 — self-reflective description of coping and environment
 supporter_324: Are you able to do more workouts? Sometimes I have found that running (which I hate doing) makes me feel so much better in times of high stress. Running also releases endorphins into the body which will help to alleviate some of the drinking/stress. — 0 — advice
12. seeker_324: I am trying to do more. I work out daily and that isgood but I am trying yoga for the second workout. — 1 — self-reflective plan for improvement
13. seeker_324: Thanks for your help. — 0 — gratitude

Conversation 6:
1.seeker_1125: Hi, I am in a town all alone and far from family. I have been really depressed. — 1 — self-reflective expression of isolation and emotional state
supporter_1125: Why are you in a town all alone? — 0 — inquiry
2.seeker_1125: Yes, I moved away and I thought I would be happier on my own but now all I do is think about them and miss them. Nobody ever has time to talk on the phone so I am all alone. — 1 — reflective reasoning about expectations vs. reality
supporter_1125: Do you have the option to move back? Because family is the most important thing at the end of the day — 0 — question and advice
3.seeker_1125: No, I was living with my mom and dad but when I moved out my brother got my room. He and I didnt get along so he would never want me to move back into the house with them either. — 0 — factual explanation
supporter_1125: At this point, you will have to ask your family to make time to talk with you and im sure they will understand if they hear where you are coming from — 0 — advice
4.seeker_1125: That is a good idea, I can reach out to my mom. Maybe I should write her an email or something? My brother was a bully and so he is a big reason that I moved. My parents encouraged us to fight and argue, it wasn't a very fun place to live. — 1 — self-reflective – 1 – we see self directed reasoning with hedging markers, where the main function being thought organizationreasoning and planning — 1 — “maybe i should…” seems like self reflective soundboarding
5.seeker_1125: I've always been closer to my mom so she is much more understanding. She helps me pay my monthly bills too. — 0 — factual statement — 1 — reflecting on closer relationship with mother and rarionalizing why
supporter_1125: Yeah reach out to your mum, and although you fight and argue, they are still your family at the end of the day — 0 — advice and reassurance
supporter_1125: Thats nice of her :) — 0 — supportive comment
6.seeker_1125: Yes, that is a good point. I have always heard the blood is thicker than water. — 0 — affirmation

supporter_1125: Have you visited them ever since? — 0 — inquiry
8.seeker_1125: No, I am too far away to stop by or go for the weekend. I would have to plan a whole trip and I cant really afford it yet. My brother knew that the pets were mine but he demanded that he keep them there and I didnt want to fight with him so I said fine. — 1 — reflective reasoning about limitations and conflict avoidance
supporter_1125: If they are your pets you should be able to keep them but you did the right thing as to not argue with your brother and your parents could help you look after them — 0 — reassurance and advice
9.seeker_1125: Yeah, you are right. Once he let the gate open just so my dog would run away, he says he didn't do it but I know him and he is really mean and vengeful. He would also pull pranks on me that were just cruel. He once told me that my cat was ran over but he was just hiding her at a friends house for a week. — 0 — factual recount of past events — 1 — lots of addendum for reflections and rationalizing: “he would also…”, “he once told me…” etc.
supporter_1125: Yeah, he doesn't seem very nice, but its good that you don't retaliate negatively — 0 — acknowledgment and praise
10.seeker_1125: Yeah, I used to be really depressed living there. I haven't thought about why I moved but you are helping me remember that i'm better off now. I am lonely but so much happier not living in the turmoil over there. — 1 — reflective realization and emotional reassessment  – 1 – the “I haven't thought about why I moved... you are helping me remember” is self-directed reasoning or reflection where the seeker explicitly state their process of thought
supporter_1125: Its a good thing you moved then because at least now you are away from him — 0 — supportive affirmation
