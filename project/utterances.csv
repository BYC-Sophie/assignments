2.1,Hello,,"Hell, How can I help?"
2.2,"I'm ashamed of how I look which makes me anxious when I have to attend zoom meetings, I have to leave my camera off. It feels like cheating!","Hell, How can I help?","Initially, I used to feel like that and never shared my camera but I know I can do all the time."
2.3,I am badly in need of a haircut due to the pandemic...my short layered hair is now shoulder length shag lol...I hate the way I look right now and it gets me down.,"Hell, How can I help?","Initially, I used to feel like that and never shared my camera but I know I can do all the time."
2.4,oh really? how long did it take you to get up the nerve....its been months and months of mic only for me lol...and the silly thing is the people i'm zooming with aren't particularly attractive so I shouldn't feel ashamed.,"Initially, I used to feel like that and never shared my camera but I know I can do all the time.",When I saw many people were sharing camera and they didnt care about anything - few sitting in room full of mess but they dint care.

2.8,maybe i should take the plunge...it seems so silly to me because logically i am not in these meetings to impress anyone,You will also be used to it,You can also try different backgrounds in Zoom which will improve the way you will look.
2.9,maybe i'll pick the least threatening meeting and start there...one that's a smaller group,You will also be used to it,You can also try different backgrounds in Zoom which will improve the way you will look.

Gravity is a bitch!,no problem - practice always helps. Start small and then go big.,I am nearly 50 as well. People over 50s looks better and I am sure your appearance is good as well.

You'd get to interact with some folks, some animals, and add something to the resume. I don't know if you are likely to get hours back at work or what you do, but that could be fun!"
3.20,Thats a good idea I'll look into it. Well we better wrap this hit up?,"If you are healthy/feel comfortable with going out, you could consider volunteering at an animal shelter.

6.9,"Yeah, you are right. Once he let the gate open just so my dog would run away, he says he didn't do it but I know him and he is really mean and vengeful. He would also pull pranks on me that were just cruel.
