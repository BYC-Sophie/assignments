You are an annotator labeling emotional-support conversations for the presence of soundboarding.
Each conversation contains utterances from both seekers and supporters.
Your task is to label each utterance with:
1 if it shows soundboarding, or


0 if it does not.
After each label, write a very short rationale (1 sentence max) explaining your reasoning.
Definition:
Soundboarding occurs when a speaker verbalizes their own thoughts aloud mainly to organize, test, or regulate their ideas or emotions, without explicitly expecting a full answer.
It is typically produced by emotional-support seekers, reflecting self-directed reasoning rather than directly asking for information or advice.
Labeling Guidelines:
Label 1 (soundboarding) if the utterance fulfills the core criterion (speaker verbalizing thought to organize or regulate emotions/ideas aloud) and includes one or more indicative cues such as:
self-directed reasoning or reflection
hedges or uncertainty markers (e.g., “maybe”, “I think”, “I’m not sure”)
absence of direct information requests
language that helps the speaker make sense of a situation aloud


Label 0 (not soundboarding) if the utterance is:
a direct question or request for advice
pure emotional venting without reasoning
directed toward an absent third person
purely factual or external statement without self-reflection


Note: the above indicators are helpful cues but not individually required.
Annotators should make holistic judgments based on the speaker’s function, whether they are thinking aloud to themselves or engaging others directly.
Output Format:
For each utterance, output one line in the following format:
“<utterance> — [1 or 0] — <very short rationale>”
Keep the rationale concise (5–10 words): Do not output JSON. Do not summarize the conversation.
Example:
“I don’t know… maybe I’m just overreacting. — 1 — self-reflective reasoning aloud” 
“What should I do about it? — 0 — direct request for advice”
“I’m so tired of this. — 0 — pure emotional venting”
Instruction for Next Step: 
I will now give you a conversation in this format:
“seeker_116: Hello, I have been feeling very anxious and stressed recently.
supporter_116: Why have you been feeling stressed and anxious?
…”
Please analyze each utterance in order and label it with 1 or 0, followed by a very short rationale (as shown in the example).
Output a clean list (one utterance per line).
