You are an expert in prompt engineering and annotation task design. I need your help to iteratively improve a prompt for labeling soundboarding in emotional-support conversations.

## Background Context

I have been using a prompt (provided below as "Original Prompt") to instruct a large language model (LLM) to label utterances in emotional-support conversations for the presence of soundboarding. The original task was binary classification: label each utterance as 1 (soundboarding) or 0 (not soundboarding).

However, I have identified a significant discrepancy: there are 25 cases where the LLM labeled utterances as 1 (soundboarding), but human annotators (two independent annotators) both labeled them as 0 (not soundboarding). This suggests that the current prompt may be leading the LLM to over-identify soundboarding.

**Important Change**: For the improved prompt, I want to change the output format from binary (0/1) to a continuous score between 0.0 and 1.0, where:
- 0.0 = definitely not soundboarding
- 1.0 = definitely soundboarding  
- Values in between represent degrees of soundboarding likelihood (e.g., 0.3 = low likelihood, 0.7 = high likelihood)

## Original Prompt

You are an annotator labeling emotional-support conversations for the presence of soundboarding.
Each conversation contains utterances from both seekers and supporters.
Your task is to label each utterance with:
1 if it shows soundboarding, or


0 if it does not.
After each label, write a very short rationale (1 sentence max) explaining your reasoning.
Definition:
Soundboarding occurs when a speaker verbalizes their own thoughts aloud mainly to organize, test, or regulate their ideas or emotions, without explicitly expecting a full answer.
It is typically produced by emotional-support seekers, reflecting self-directed reasoning rather than directly asking for information or advice.
Labeling Guidelines:
Label 1 (soundboarding) if the utterance fulfills the core criterion (speaker verbalizing thought to organize or regulate emotions/ideas aloud) and includes one or more indicative cues such as:
self-directed reasoning or reflection
hedges or uncertainty markers (e.g., “maybe”, “I think”, “I’m not sure”)
absence of direct information requests
language that helps the speaker make sense of a situation aloud


Label 0 (not soundboarding) if the utterance is:
a direct question or request for advice
pure emotional venting without reasoning
directed toward an absent third person
purely factual or external statement without self-reflection


Note: the above indicators are helpful cues but not individually required.
Annotators should make holistic judgments based on the speaker’s function, whether they are thinking aloud to themselves or engaging others directly.
Output Format:
For each utterance, output one line in the following format:
“<utterance> — [1 or 0] — <very short rationale>”
Keep the rationale concise (5–10 words): Do not output JSON. Do not summarize the conversation.
Example:
“I don’t know… maybe I’m just overreacting. — 1 — self-reflective reasoning aloud” 
“What should I do about it? — 0 — direct request for advice”
“I’m so tired of this. — 0 — pure emotional venting”
Instruction for Next Step: 
I will now give you a conversation in this format:
“seeker_116: Hello, I have been feeling very anxious and stressed recently.
supporter_116: Why have you been feeling stressed and anxious?
…”
Please analyze each utterance in order and label it with 1 or 0, followed by a very short rationale (as shown in the example).
Output a clean list (one utterance per line).

## Misclassification Data

I have a table containing 25 cases of misclassification. Each case includes:
- **Index**: The utterance identifier (e.g., "1.5", "2.3")
- **Content**: The Seeker's utterance that was misclassified
- **supporter-pre**: The Supporter's utterance immediately before this Seeker utterance (context)
- **supporter-post**: The Supporter's utterance immediately after this Seeker utterance (context)
- **gpt5**: The LLM's label (all are 1 in this dataset)
- **annotator1**: Human annotator 1's label (all are 0)
- **annotator2**: Human annotator 2's label (all are 0)
- **human_aggregate**: Aggregate human label (0, since both annotators said 0)

The table will be provided separately. For each case, you should consider:
1. The Seeker's utterance itself
2. The conversational context (what the Supporter said before and after)
3. Why the LLM might have labeled it as 1
4. Why humans labeled it as 0

## Your Task

Please analyze this situation and provide a comprehensive response in the following structure:

### Part 1: Root Cause Analysis

First, analyze why the LLM is labeling these 25 utterances as soundboarding (1) when humans consistently label them as 0. Consider:
- What patterns or linguistic features in these utterances might have triggered the LLM's "soundboarding" label?
- How might the original prompt's guidelines be ambiguous or leading to over-identification?
- What contextual cues (from supporter-pre and supporter-post) might the LLM be misinterpreting?
- Are there specific words, phrases, or sentence structures that appear frequently in these misclassified cases?

Provide a detailed analysis of the root causes.

### Part 2: Three Improvement Plans

Based on your analysis, propose THREE distinct plans to improve the prompt. Each plan should:

**Plan 1: [Name/Description]**
- Specific changes to make to the prompt
- Rationale for why these changes would address the misclassification issue
- Expected impact on reducing false positives

**Plan 2: [Name/Description]**
- Specific changes to make to the prompt
- Rationale for why these changes would address the misclassification issue
- Expected impact on reducing false positives

**Plan 3: [Name/Description]**
- Specific changes to make to the prompt
- Rationale for why these changes would address the misclassification issue
- Expected impact on reducing false positives

Each plan should take a different approach (e.g., one might focus on clarifying definitions, another on adding negative examples, another on emphasizing context).

### Part 3: Plan Recommendation

Compare the three plans and recommend which one you believe would be most effective. Explain:
- Why this plan is superior to the others
- What combination of elements from different plans might work best
- Any potential risks or limitations of the recommended approach

### Part 4: Final Improved Prompt

Provide the complete, revised prompt that incorporates your recommended improvements. The prompt should:
- Maintain the original structure and format
- Clearly address the identified issues
- Be ready to use for the annotation task
- Include all necessary components (definition, guidelines, examples, output format)
- **IMPORTANT**: The output format should be a continuous score between 0 and 1 (not binary 0/1), where:
  - 0.0 means definitely not soundboarding
  - 1.0 means definitely soundboarding
  - Values closer to 1 indicate higher likelihood of soundboarding
  - Values closer to 0 indicate lower likelihood of soundboarding
  - The score should reflect the degree/confidence of soundboarding presence

### Part 5: Thinking Process

Document your complete thinking process throughout this analysis:
- How you identified patterns in the misclassified cases
- Your reasoning for each proposed change
- Trade-offs you considered
- Why you ultimately chose the recommended approach

## Output Format

Please structure your response as follows:

```

## Important Notes

- Focus on reducing false positives (cases labeled as 1 by LLM but 0 by humans)
- Maintain the prompt's ability to correctly identify true soundboarding cases
- Consider the conversational context when making recommendations
- Be specific and actionable in your suggestions
- Ensure the improved prompt is clear, unambiguous, and easy for an LLM to follow
- **Output Format Requirement**: The improved prompt must output a continuous score between 0.0 and 1.0 (not binary 0/1), representing the likelihood/degree of soundboarding. Examples: 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0

Supporter After: Well, drinking doesn't really deal with it. It only pushes things off for later to deal with. Exercising is a really good way to deal with that stress.

Supporter After: Are you able to do more workouts? Sometimes I have found that running (which I hate doing) makes me feel so much better in times of high stress. Running also releases endorphins into the body which will help to alleviate some of the drinking/stress.
