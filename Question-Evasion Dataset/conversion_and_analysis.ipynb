Mayo Clinic's problems with the House proposal:\\n- The Mayo Clinic initially had concerns and was critical of the original House bill.\\n- They were specifically concerned about the delivery system and cost-saving measures.\\n- However, after learning about the specific mechanisms like the MedPAC idea (experts making decisions based on evidence), they expressed support for these ideas.\\n\\n2. Expectations from visiting the Cleveland Clinic:\\n- The speaker is not expecting an endorsement from the Cleveland Clinic.\\n- The Cleveland Clinic is seen as a role model for the desired changes in healthcare delivery.\\n\\nThere is no information provided regarding the question about tomorrow's visit to the Cleveland Clinic and what the speaker hopes to achieve.\",\n",
