- ""clear-nonreply"": the answer clearly does not address the question (for example, it may refuse to answer, express ignorance, or shift to asking for clarification instead of answering).
- ""ambivalent-reply"": the answer partially addresses the question or is indirectly related, showing ambiguity or incompleteness (for example, it may be vague, evasive, or only partially relevant).

Return your decision in **strict JSON** with two fields and nothing else:
{""label"": ""<one of: clear-reply | clear-nonreply | ambivalent-reply>"", ""rationale"": ""<one-sentence explanation>""}

Question: Personal, moral responsibility for the situation in Aleppo
Answer: Good. Mike, I always feel responsible. I've felt responsible when kids were being shot by snipers. I felt responsible when millions of people had been displaced. I feel responsible for murder and s that's taken place in South Sudan that's not being reported on partly because there's not as much social media being generated from there.There are places around the world where horrible things are happening, and because of my office, because I'm President of the United States, I feel responsible. I ask myself every single day, is there something I could do that would save lives and make a difference and spare some child who doesn't deserve to suffer. So that's a starting point. There's not a moment during the course of this Presidency where I haven't felt some responsibility. That's true, by the way, for our own country. When I came into office and people were losing their jobs and losing their homes and losing their pensions, I felt responsible, and I would go home at night, and I would ask myself, was there something better that I could do or smarter that I could be that would make a difference in their lives, that would relieve their suffering and relieve their hardship?So, with respect to Syria, what I have consistently done is taken the best course that I can to try to end the civil war while having also to take into account the long-term national security interests of the United States.And throughout this process, based on hours of meetings—if you tallied it up, days or weeks of meetings where we went through every option in painful detail, with maps, and we had our military, and we had our aid agencies, and we had our diplomatic teams, and sometimes, we'd bring in outsiders who were critics of ours—whenever we went through it, the challenge was that, short of putting large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground, uninvited, without any international law mandate, without sufficient support from Congress, at a time when we still had troops in Afghanistan and we still had troops in Iraq and we had just gone through over a decade of war and spent trillions of dollars, and when the opposition on the ground was not cohesive enough to necessarily govern a country, and you had a military superpower in Russia prepared to do whatever it took to keep its client state involved, and you had a regional military power in Iran that saw their own vital strategic interests at stake and were willing to send in as many of their people or proxies to support the regime—that in that circumstance, unless we were all in and willing to take over Syria, we were going to have problems, and that everything else was tempting because we wanted to do something and it sounded like the right thing to do, but it was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap.And in that circumstance, I have to make a decision as President of the United States as to what is best——[] . I'm sorry, what's going on?",clear-reply,clear-reply,True
